# Metro-Station-Shortest-Distance

PHP & Graph Analytics (OrientDB) solution that calculates the shortest path between two Metro Stations
The stations are listed in a text file.

This happens to be a hiring test that I had in the past, and it ended up being an interesting challenge and triggering the passion for Graph solutions. Later in my career I would have a chance to apply Graph concepts again, in Data Engineering, tracing the data lineage for existing Datasets.
